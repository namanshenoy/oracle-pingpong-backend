<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Oracle NoSQL Database is a distributed key-value store capable of scaling
horizontally to handle very large amounts of data.
</p>
<p>
The Oracle NoSQL Database server is compatible with Java SE 8 (64-bit) and
later, and the client is compatible with Java SE 6 and later.  Both have been
tested and certified against Oracle Java SE 8 Update 73.  We encourage
you to upgrade to the latest Java releases to take advantage of the
latest bug fixes and performance improvements.
</p>
<p>
Attempting to use this release with a version of Java earlier than the
required version will produce an error message similar to:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
  oracle/kv/impl/util/KVStoreMain : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="release">This Release</a></h2>
<p>
This is release 12cR1.4.3.11 Community Edition of Oracle NoSQL Database.  It follows
major release 4.0.9 and minor release 4.3.10.
</p>
<h3>Differences between 12cR1.4.3.11 Community Edition and Release 4.3.10</h3>
<p>
Release 12cR1.4.3.11 Community Edition of Oracle NoSQL Database is a patch
release. We strongly recommend that users of earlier versions upgrade to
this release.  For a complete listing of all the changes made to Oracle
NoSQL Database for this release (including all bug fixes) see
the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="features">New Features</a></h2>
<!-- Descriptions major features for the initial major release and
     subsequent minor releases, in reverse order -->
<h3>New in Release 4.3</h3>
<h4>Oracle NoSQL Database Community Edition (CE) License Change</h4>
<p>
 Oracle NoSQL Database server Community Edition (CE) is now released
 under Apache License, Version 2.0 (Apache 2.0). Previously it was
 released under the Affero General Public License (aGPL v3). The
 licenses for the other distributions are unchanged.
</p>
<h4>Oracle NoSQL Database will create secure stores by default</h4>
<p>
Starting this release, Oracle NoSQL Database will create all stores as
secure stores by default, including those created by
<code>kvlite</code>. The user will have to set
the <code>-store-security</code> option to <code>none</code> in
the <code>makebootconfig</code> to create non-secure
stores. For <code>kvlite</code>, use <code>-secure-config disable</code>
option to create non-secure store.
</p>
<h4>Support for querying JSON data type fields</h4>
<p>
SQL for Oracle NoSQL Database now supports querying and manipulating
data stored as JSON data types in its DML queries. Creating and storing
fields of type JSON was introduced in the previous release as a preview
and is now made available as general release. Indexed JSON queries are
not supported in this release and as a result some queries may experience
performance issues.
</p>
<h4>Introducing TIMESTAMP data type</h4>
<p>
Users can create a table of type TIMESTAMP using the TABLE API and can
query fields of type TIMESTAMP using the SQL for Oracle NoSQL query
language.
</p>
<h4>Storage Engine (JE) Stats available through JMX</h4>
<p>
Storage Engine (JE) statistics that are written to the
&lt;kvroot>/log/&lt;storename&gt;.stats and
&lt;kvroot&gt;/log/&lt;storename&gt;.perf files are now made available
through the Oracle NoSQL JMX agent via the standard
javax.management.Notification mechanism in JSON format. This allows
users to make a single call to obtain all the JE stats for a particular
component as opposed to a call for every JE stat.
</p>
<h4>Increased parallelism in Predicate Push Down</h4>
<p>
The Predicate Push Down feature has been enhanced so that when the input
splits are generated (on the client side), partition and shard
information is now employed to produce splits that are distributed to
the Datanodes of the Hadoop cluster. This enhancement results in optimum
parallelization of the predicate filtering that is performed on the
Oracle NoSQL Database server.
</p>
<h3>New in Release 4.2</h3>
<h4>Storage Directory Based Topology Layout</h4>
<p>
Topology layout now takes storage directory size information into
account.  If storage directory sizes have been specified for Storage
Nodes, then the deploy, rebalance, redistribute, and contract topology
commands will adjust shards and partitions to take directory sizes into
account.
</p>
<h4>Improved Write Availability With RF=2</h4>
<p>
Stores with replication factor 2 can now continue to support writes
after single node failures if the store includes Arbiter nodes, a new
type of lightweight node that allows the system to select a master if
one of the two replication nodes in a shard becomes unavailable.
Arbiters can be used to improve availability without increasing the
number of data replicas maintained by the store.
</p>
<h4>Store Contraction</h4>
<p>
The new <code>topology contract</code> command makes it possible to
reduce the size of a store by eliminating storage nodes and reducing the
number of shards.  The replication factor is not changed.
</p>
<h4>General Release of Query and Full Text Search</h4>
<p>
The query language and full text search are now general release
features.
</p>
<h4>Preview release of API support for a JSON data type</h4>
<p>
Limited support for declaring and using a JSON data type is provided
as a preview release. See the 
<a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for  more information.
</p>
<h3>New in Release 4.0</h3>
<h4>Query</h4>
<p>
Added a preview release of an SQL-style declarative query language to
support server side predicates, filtering, and projection of table
data. The new features include the language itself, APIs for querying
and results handling, as well as a new interactive shell to exercise
queries.
</p>
<h4>Full Text Search</h4>
<p>
Added a preview release of integration with Elasticsearch to provide
full text search indexing.  Text indexes can be added to tables in
Oracle NoSQL Database, which will cause a corresponding index in an
attached Elasticsearch cluster to be populated and maintained.
</p>
<h4>TTL</h4>
<p>
Added support for Time-To-Live (TTL), which allows applications to
request automatic purging of records after a given time interval.  A
default TTL can be specified for all entries in a table, and a TTL value
can also be specified for individual table operations.  For applications
whose data should expire over time, the TTL feature provides better
performance than deleting records explicitly.
</p>
<h4>Export/Import Utility</h4>
<p>
Added Export and Import utilities. The new utilities allows users to
export the contents from Oracle NoSQL Database store to either the local
file system or to the Oracle Storage Cloud Service, and to import
contents from the locations into an Oracle NoSQL Database store.
</p>
<h2><a name="distributions">Distributions</a></h2>
<p>
    Oracle NoSQL Database comes in four distributions:
    Community Edition (CE), Enterprise Edition (EE), Basic Edition (BE),
    and Client.
</p>
<p>
    The CE version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (Apache 2.0). It
    includes the client and server distribution, but does not include
    some server features.
</p>
<p>
    The EE version does not include source code and it ships with an
    Oracle license. The EE version includes the client and server
    distribution, and includes several features not found in the CE
    version: Oracle External Tables support, Oracle Wallet support for
    external password storage, and support for Kerberos authentication.
</p>
<p>
    The BE version only contains the server and is distributed under the
    Oracle Database Enterprise Edition license. The BE version does not
    include source code, and is functionally identical to CE.
</p>
<p>
    The Client version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Apache 2.0 License (Apache 2.0).  The Client
    version only contains the implementation of the client API, which
    may be used to access servers running under CE, EE, or BE.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, example code is provided in its own package, which can be
  used with any of the three main distributions.
</p>
<h2><a name="building">Building from Source Code in the Community
Edition</a></h2>
<p>
If you have downloaded the Community Edition, you can use the included
Ant build script to rebuild JAR files if you make source changes.
</p>
<p>
You need Apache Ant version 1.9.0 or later in order to do builds.  You
can download Ant from:
</p>
<blockquote>
http://ant.apache.org/
</blockquote>
<p>
You also need Apache Ivy for loading dependencies.  You can download Ivy
from:
</p>
<blockquote>
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/
</blockquote>
<p>
Make sure to add the ivy JAR file to your <tt>~/.ant/lib</tt> directory
or specify the ivy directory using the ant <tt>-lib</tt> option.
</p>
<p>
The default Ant target will rebuild all JAR files.
</p>
<h2><a name="issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
<h3>Performance overhead for secure store </h3>
<p>
In our testing, we have found that suites using the GCM cipher algorithm
mode provide better performance than suites using CBC mode, particularly
on hardware with limited sources of secure randomness.  Note, though,
that performance may depend on the workload and hardware configuration.
</p>
<h3>Incompatibility with existing SQL for Oracle NoSQL syntax </h3>
<p>
  The syntax for many of the pre-existing expressions in SQL for Oracle NoSQL
  have changed in this release. As a result, applications may have to change
  their queries to be compatible with the new syntax. See
  <a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for  more information.
</p>
<h3>Referencing an index path that does not exist</h3>
<p>
A NPE may occur when the user tries to create an index on a path that
does not exist.The NPE can show up for both maps and arrays if the path
leading to the map/array that is being indexed does not exist.[#25627] </p>
<h3>Full Text Search and elasticity operations</h3>
<p>
There is a known bug that may prevent text index from populating
writes to remote ES cluster properly in some scenarios involving elasticity
operations. As a result, front-end writes to migrated partitions may not get
replicated to ES cluster in a timely manner. To work around, user can 1) stop
all front-end writes affecting text index, let all existing updates go to ES;
2) conduct elasticity operations, and 3) after elasticity operations are all
over, resume front-end writes. [#25334] </p>
