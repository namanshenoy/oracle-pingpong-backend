      <p>
            While creating index views can vastly improve
            your stores read performance (depending on the size of your
            data set, and the kinds of questions you want to ask of it),
            there are some limitations of which you need to be aware.
        </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="additionalwrite"></a>Additional Write Activity</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                Maintaining an index view necessarily requires
                additional read and write activity over and above what is
                required just to maintain a primary record. Whether this
                additional activity will measurably affect your write
                throughput depends on the size of the dataset you are
                indexing, and the size of your views. 
            </p>
        <p>
                For small datasets and small views, this additional
                activity will not be noticeable. But as the size of the
                data to be indexed grows, and so your views themselves
                grow larger, you might notice a reduction in throughput,
                particularly in write throughput. Given this, when planning
                your store size, be sure to consider overhead to maintain
                index views.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                Because index views are managed by the application, Oracle NoSQL Database
                cannot insure that operations performed on the primary
                record are atomic with operations performed on the
                corresponding view records.  This means that it is possible
                to change your primary records, but have the corresponding
                operation(s) on your index view(s) fail thereby causing
                them to be out of sync with the primary data. The reverse
                can also happen, where the index view update operation is
                successful, but the update to the primary record fails.
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that for some workloads, non-atomic updates to primary
                records and their index views can be desirable. This is
                sometimes the case for workloads that require the maximum
                read and write throughput possible. For these types of
                applications, consistency between the index view and the
                primary data is not nearly as important as overall
                performance. 
            </p>
        <p>
                That said, you should still make an attempt to determine
                whether your indexes are out of sync relative to your
                primary data, so that you can perform compensating
                transactions if your code detects a problem.
                You may also need to flag your index views as being in an
                unsafe state if some aspect of the update operations fail.
                The safest way (not necessarily the fastest way) to update
                a primary record for which you are maintaining an index
                view is:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Check whether your view is in a READY state. If
                        it is, proceed with the update operation. If it
                        is not, either pause and wait for the state to
                        change, or abort the update entirely.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Update your primary record as necessary, but
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>do not write the results back to the
                        store yet.</em></span>
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Update your index view to be reflective of the
                        changes you have made to the primary record.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Write the primary record to the store.
                        If the write fails, perform a compensating
                        transaction to fix the problem. Either retry the
                        write operation with the updated record, or check
                        to ensure that the record which is currently in the store 
                        is not corrupted or altered in any way.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the update to the primary record succeeds, then 
                        write the changes to the index view to the store.
                        If this succeeds, then you are done with your
                        update.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the update to the index view record fails, then
                        immediately mark your index view as being in a
                        non-READY state. How you do this depends on how you
                        are storing index view state flags, but assuming
                        you are using metadata records, that needs to be
                        updated before you take steps to fix your index
                        view.
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
                A similar algorithm is required for the creation and
                deletion of primary records.
            </p>
        <p>
                Of course, this means that before you perform a read with
                your index view, you need to check the view's state before
                you proceed. If the view's state is not READY, then you
                need to either pause until the state is READY, or you need
                to abandon the read entirely. In addition to this check,
                you also need to ensure that your index views are in a
                state that is consistent with the primary records. This is
                described next.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="secondary-consistency"></a>Decoupled Consistency</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                As described above, index views can be out of sync with
                your primary data due to some generic failure in the update
                operation. Your code needs to be robust enough to recognize
                when this has happened, and take corrective action
                (including rebuilding the index view, if necessary).
                A related, but temporary, problem is that for
                any given node, changes to your views may not have caught up
                to changes to your primary records due to replication
                delays. Note that it is also possible for views on the
                local node to have been updated when the corresponding
                primary data modifications have not yet arrived.
            </p>
        <p>
                Again, for some workloads, it might not be critically
                important that your views are in sync with your primary
                data. However, if your workload is such that you need
                assurance your views accurately reflect your primary
                data, you need to make use of Oracle NoSQL Database's built-in consistency
                guarantees.
            </p>
        <p>
                One way to do this is to use an absolute consistency
                guarantee for any reads that you perform using your views.
                But this can ultimately harm your read and write
                performance because absolute consistency requires the read
                operation to be performed on a master node. 
                (See 
                <a class="xref" href="consistency-pre.html" title="Using Simple Consistency">Using Simple Consistency</a>
                 for details.) For this reason, you should use absolute
                 consistency only when it is truly critical that your views
                 are completely up-to-date relative to your primary data.
            </p>
        <p>
                A better way to resolve the problem is to use a version-based
                consistency guarantee when using your index views.
                You will need to check the version information on
                both the primary data and the views when
                performing your reads in order to ensure that they are in
                sync. You may also need to create a way to transfer version
                information between different processes in your
                application, if one process is responsible for performing
                store writes and other processes are performing store
                reads. For details on using version-based consistency, see
                <a class="xref" href="consistency-version.html" title="Using Version-Based Consistency">Using Version-Based Consistency</a>.
