      <p>
        Oracle NoSQL Database provides an interface you can use to read and write Large
        Objects (LOBs) such as audio and video files. As a general rule,
        any object greater than 1 MB is a good candidate for representation
        as a LOB. The LOB API permits access to large values, without
        having to materialize the value in its entirety by providing
        streaming APIs for reading and writing these objects.
    </p>
      <p>
        A LOB is stored as a sequence of chunks whose sizes are optimized
        for the underlying storage system. The chunks constituting a LOB
        may not all be the same size. Individual chunk sizes are chosen
        automatically by the system based upon its knowledge of the
        underlying storage architecture and hardware. Splitting a LOB into
        chunks permits low latency operations across mixed workloads with
        values of varying sizes. The stream based APIs serve to insulate
        the application from the actual representation of the LOB in the
        underlying storage system.
    </p>
      <p>
        The LOB interface makes use of text-only keys that can be used
        with either the Tables API or the Key/Value API.  This document
        provides high-level concepts pertinent to the LOB interface,
        and then provides examples of using it with both the Tables and
        the Key/Value APIs.

        <p>
            LOBs are stored and retrieved using
            <code class="classname">oracle.kv.Key</code> objects.  Each such object
            contains a series of strings which represent a key path. Key
            paths are divided into two parts: major and (optionally) minor.
            The last key path component in a LOB key must end with a
            trailing suffix that is <code class="literal">.lob</code> by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            The LOB suffix may be defined using the
            <code class="methodname">KVStoreConfig.setLOBSuffix()</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike other objects stored using
            <code class="classname">Key</code> objects (such as when using the
            Key/Value API), LOB data is not stored on shards driven by the
            major and minor key path components in the key path. Instead,
            LOB data uses a hidden keyspace, and its various chunks are
            distributed across partitions based on this keyspace, instead
            of based on the <code class="classname">Key</code> which you provide. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, be aware that the actual key you use for your LOBs is
            stored on a single partition based on its major/minor key path
            components, and the partition used for this storage is selected
            in the same way that the store partitions any data based on the
            key's major and minor key paths.  However, assuming reasonably
            brief keys, this represents a small amount of data and it
            should not substantially affect your store's data sizing
            requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of this section provides a brief overview of Oracle NoSQL Database
            <code class="classname">Key</code>s, which may be of interest to users
            of the Table API. Key/Value API users should already be
            familiar with these concepts and so they can skip to the next
            section.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <code class="classname">Key</code> object can be constructed in several
            different ways, depending on how you want to represent the key
            path components.  Most commonly, arrays are used to represent
            the major and minor key path components, and these
            arrays are then provided to the
            <code class="methodname">Key.createKey()</code> method. Users of the
            Table API may find the
            <code class="methodname">Key.fromString()</code> method convenient
            because it is easy to store a string representation of a key
            path in a table cell. Alternatively, Table API users can store
            key paths components as arrays in table cells, or construct the
            key path array using information found in table cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            When represented as a string, key paths begin with a forward
            slash ('/), which is also used to delimit each path
            component.  If a minor key path is used, then it is delimited
            from the major key path using a dash ('-). For example, a LOB
            key used for an image file might be:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">/Records/People/-/Smith/Sam/Image.lob</pre>
        <p>
            Users of the Table API should take care to ensure that their
            LOB paths do not collide with the keys used internally by their
            tables. In general this is easy to do because the key paths
            used internally to store table data begin with a numerical
            representation of the table's name.
