            Index views are a design pattern you use to create auxiliary
            records that are reflective of information contained in your
            primary records. There are many ways you can create index
            views.  This document describes two of them.
        </p>

        <p>
                This article assumes that you are using Oracle NoSQL Database's Key/Value
                API and have read and understood the
                <em class="citetitle">Oracle NoSQL Database Getting Started with the Key/Value API</em> guide. If you have not read
                that manual, you should do so before reading this document.
            </p>
        <p>
                Users of the Tables API have a built-in indexing mechanism
                available, and so this article is not meant for them.
            </p>
      </div>
      <p>
            As described in 
            <a class="xref" href="recordget.html" title="Chapter 5. Reading Records">Reading Records</a>
            records are generally retrieved from the store using their key
            major and minor paths. You can either retrieve a single record
            using its key, or you can retrieve multiple records using part
            of a major path and then iterate over the result.
        </p>
      <p>
            For example, suppose your store contains records related to
            users. The key might contain user organization information and
            other identifying information such as a user ID.  Each record's
            data, however, would likely contain additional details about
            people such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and so forth.
            While your application may frequently want to query a person by
            user ID (that is, by the information stored as a part of the
            key path), it may also on occasion want to locate people by,
            say, their name.
        </p>
      <p>
            Rather than iterating through all of the records in your store,
            examining each in turn for a given person's name, you can
            instead create application-managed index views. There are
            multiple ways to implement index views, but in general they are
            simply key/value pairs where the key relates to some
            information within your primary record, and the value
            identifies the primary record where that information can be
            found.
        </p>
      <p>
            That is, if you had a record which contained the name
            <code class="literal">Peter</code>, then the key for its index view would
            contain <code class="literal">Peter</code> and the value would contain
            the major and minor key paths to that record.
        </p>
      <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            This method of creating index views is, intuitively, the way many developers familiar
            with key/value stores will think to implement views.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a different approach to building index views, see
            <a class="xref" href="keyonlyindexviews.html" title="Using Key-Only Records">Using Key-Only Records</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use traditional key/data pair records to build index
            views, you create records where:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    The record's key path is some information in your primary data records that
                    you want to quickly query.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    The record's data is the key path to a record which has the
                    information contained in the key path.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            For example, suppose you had records that used the following
            schema:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "PrimaryDBValue",
    "namespace": "oracle.kv.indexView",
    "fields": [
        {"name": "name", "type": "string", "default": ""},
        {"name": "email", "type": "string", "default": ""},
        {"name": "phone", "type": "string", "default": ""},
        {"name": "date", "type": "string", "default": ""}, 
        {"name": "org", "type": "string", "default": ""}, 
        {"name": "cost", "type": "long", "default": 0} 
    ]
}
</pre>
        <p>
        Further, suppose these records are stored using the employee's
        unique identifier. For example, these records might use key paths 
        which end with an employee unique identifier, like this:
    </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">/Corporate/people/10012
/Corporate/people/10013
/Corporate/people/10014</pre>
        <p>
        In this case, in order to find all people who belong to the
        organization called "Support," you would have to iterate over 
        every record whose key begins with <code class="literal">/Corporate/people</code>,
        examine each in turn for the proper organization name, and
        construct a list of those people who belong to that organization.
        Depending on the number of people contained in your store, this
        could be a lengthy operation.
    </p>
        <p>
        The alternative is to create an index view that is keyed by the
        organization name. For example:
    </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">/IndexView/People/Organization/Engineering
/IndexView/People/Organization/Sales
/IndexView/People/Organization/Support</pre>
        <p>
        There are two ways to handle the data portion of these records. One
        way is for each record to contain a list of keys corresponding to
        the people records belonging to that organization. That is, the
        key:
    </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">/IndexView/People/Organization/Support</pre>
        <p>
        would return a data item with was a list of major keys for all those
        people entries containing an 'org' of 'Support'. As an Avro schema,
        you would represent the data item in the following way:
    </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "SecondaryDBValue",
    "namespace": "oracle.kv.indexView",
    "fields": [
        {"name": "arrays", 
         "type": {"type" : "array", "items" : "string"}, 
         "default" : []}
  ]
} </pre>
        <p>
            While this approach will work for small-to-medium sized
            indexes, it ultimately suffers from an inability to scale.
            It would be far too easy to create a view whose list of primary
            keys is too large to be easily handled by your code. In fact,
            it could easily grow so large that it could not fit into
            available memory. Given the size of the datasets for which
            Oracle NoSQL Database is designed, this is a very real consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
            A different approach would be to create index views where each
            record referred to one and only one primary record. That is,
            the data portion of the record contains a simple string
            representing the key path to a primary record. (You could also
            carry this information as an array of key path components.)
            However, you cannot duplicate keys in Oracle NoSQL Database, so in this case
            the key needs to somehow be unique, based on the information
            found in the primary record. As an example, you could create
            keys that contains both the organization name, as well as the
            user's UID:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">/IndexView/People/Organization/Support/-/10012</pre>
        <p>
            refers to the primary record:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">/Corporate/People/10012</pre>
