            Key-only index view records carry all of the record's
            information in the key; the data portion of the record is set
            to an empty value. In this scheme, each index view record
            represents a single pairing between the secondary key and the
            primary record key to which it refers. Because Oracle NoSQL Database is good
            at scaling up to large numbers of records, this eliminates the
            scalability problem described in the previous section.

                The following examples use fairly long key paths. This is
                done for the purpose of clarity. However, in general,
                shorter key paths are desirable and so the paths shown
                here should not be taken as advice for how to construct the
                keys for your records.
            </p>
      </div>
      <p>
            Essentially, key-only index view records carry the index view's
            key in the major portion of the key path, and the corresponding
            primary record's key in the minor portion of the key path. That
            is:
        </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">/Secondary/Key/Path/-/Primary/Key/Path</pre>
      <p>
            The minor path component here is the key path for a primary
            record. For example, building on the example presented in the
            previous section, this might be:
        </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">/Secondary/Key/Path/-/Corporate/people/10012</pre>
      <p>
            The major key path portion of the record needs to carry more
            information:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    Index key prefix
                </p>
            <p>
                    This is simply a prefix value used to indicate that the
                    record is an index view record. The prefix can be
                    anything so long as it is unique within your store; for example, 
                    <code class="literal">IDX</code>.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Index name
                </p>
            <p>
                    This is used to differentiate this index view from
                    other types of index views. You could use something
                    fairly simple here that is indicative of the
                    information indexed by this record, such as <code class="literal">EMPLOYEE_NAME</code> 
                    or <code class="literal">EMPLOYEE_LOCATION</code>. However, it is
                    possible to carry more complex information if you
                    set up your code correctly. We discuss this further in
                    <a class="xref" href="keyonlyindexviews.html#complexindexname" title="Complex Index Names">Complex Index Names</a>.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Field value(s)
                </p>
            <p>
                    The remainder of the major key path is a sequence
                    of one or more field values that are obtained from the
                    associated primary record. This is the actual
                    information that you are indexing.
                </p>
            <p>
                    In the simplest case, this portion of the key contains
                    only one field value; for example, an organization name
                    if what you are doing is indexing all employees by
                    organization. For example:
                </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">/IDX/ORGANIZATION/Engineering/-/Corporate/people/10012</pre>
            <p>
                    is a view entry that indicates employee record 10012
                    belongs to the Engineering organization.
                </p>
            <p>
                    However, this portion of the key path can contain
                    multiple field values, which gives you multi-column
                    views. An example of this is indexing by employee
                    common and family name, both of which would be
                    individual fields in the primary record:
                </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">/IDX/EMP_NAME/Smith/Robert/-/Corporate/people/10012
/IDX/EMP_NAME/Smith/Patricia/-/Corporate/people/40288
/IDX/EMP_NAME/Smyth/Don/-/Corporate/people/7893</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

        <p>
                As described above, an index name can be a simple text
                label, especially if you have fairly simple indexing
                requirements. However, it is possible to carry more
                information about the view record in the index name. You
                can construct the index name so that it identifies:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        The Avro schema name used by the primary record.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        A list of the field names that this view is
                        indexing. This information is useful for
                        generalizing your Avro binding code, especially as
                        the number of fields you are indexing grows large,
                        and/or as the number of types of index views grows
                        large.
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                One way to construct an index name that carries this
                information is to create a list object that holds all the
                information you want in your index name, 
                then create a one-way hash of the information using 
                <code class="classname">java.security.MessageDigest</code>.
                Converting the list to a byte array can be accomplished
                using the <code class="methodname">Key.createKey()</code>
                method. For example:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">    /**
     * Construct and return an index name representing an index type.
     */
    private String getIndexName(String schemaName,
                                List&lt;String&gt; indexFieldNames) {

        MessageDigest md = null;
        try {
            /* 
             * The implementation for digestCache is omitted 
             * for brevity.
             */
            md = digestCache.get();
            List&lt;String&gt; minorPath = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
            minorPath.add(schemaName);
            minorPath.addAll(indexFieldNames);
            byte[] bytes = 
                Key.createKey("", minorPath).toString().getBytes();
            md.update(bytes);
            return new String(md.digest());
        } finally {
            digestCache.free(md);
        }
    } </pre>
        <p>
                This means that the information you are carrying in your
                index name is locked up in a one-way hash. There is no way
                to retrieve that information from the hash, so you need to
                store it somewhere. You need a separate set of records to
                record index view metadata.
            </p>

                Index view metadata is information you want to record about
                each index type. Mostly, this is information you use to
                construct your index names (if you use complex index
                names). You can also record your index state as a part of
                your metadata.
            </p>
        <p>
                You can collect your index view metadata as a series of
                key-only records. In this case, the keys are constructed
                like this:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">/PREFIX/INDEX_NAME/-/SCHEMA_NAME/FNAME1/FNAME2/.../STATE</pre>
        <p>
                where:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">PREFIX</code> is a unique identifier
                        that you use to indicate this record is an index
                        view metadata record. For example:
                        <code class="literal">META</code>.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">INDEX_NAME</code> is the name you are using for
                        the type of index for which you are collecting metadata. If
                        you are using a simple name (for example,
                        <code class="literal">ORGANIZATION</code> or
                        <code class="literal">EMP_NAME</code>), then use that. If you
                        are using a hashed complex name, such as is
                        described in the previous section, then use that
                        here.

                        be the same schema name as you used to construct
                        your complex index name.

                        primary record field names this view type is
                        using. Again, these must be identical to the field
                        names you used to construct your complex index
                        name. They must also appear in the same order as
                        the field values used to construct your index
                        view record keys.

                        record, along with your Avro binding, to

                        Check the status of the index view to ensure that
                        it is in a READY state. If it is, then write the
                        index view record back to the store.

              <p>
                        If the index view status is not READY, then either
                        wait for the status to change to READY before
                        writing the index view record, or fail the
                        operation.

                An example of performing all these operations is available
                in your Oracle NoSQL Database distribution. See

                The longer your keys, the more memory you are using at your
                nodes. Keys can therefore grow so large that they harm your
                system's overall read/write throughput due to an inability
                to maintain enough records in cache.
            </p>
        <p>
                The key-only design pattern described here will probably result in very long
                keys. Whether those key sizes are so large that they cause
                you a performance problem is a function of how long your
                keys actually are, how many keys you need to manage, and
                how much memory is available on your nodes.
            </p>
        <p>
                If your keys are so large that they will cause an I/O
                throughput issue, then you need to implement some other
                design approach.
