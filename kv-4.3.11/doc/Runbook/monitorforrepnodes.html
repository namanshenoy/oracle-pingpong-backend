                       be automatically restarted. Administrative
                       intervention is required. The user can start 
                       looking for SEVERE entries in both the service's 
                       log file and the log file of the SNA controlling 
                       the failed service. The service's log in Monitoring 
                       for RN section is RN log:
                       </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;kvroot&gt;/&lt;storename&gt;/log/rg*-rn*_*.log</pre><p>
                       where, &lt;kvroot&gt; and &lt;storename&gt; are user 
                       inputs and * represents the number of the log. For 
                       example: rg3-rn2_0.log is the latest log, rg3-rn2_1.log 
                       is previous log. 
                      </p><p>
                       Note that the kvroot and storename will 
                       be different for every installation. Similarly, to find 
                       the log file for SNA, use:
                       </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;kvroot&gt;/&lt;storename&gt;/log/sn*_*.log</pre>
                       Examples of SN logs can be: sn1_0.log, sn1_1.log.
                       <p>
                        You can search SEVERE keyword in these log files, and 
                        then read the searched messages to fix the errors, or 
                        you may require help from Oracle NoSQL Database support. The action 
                        to take depends on the nature of the failure and can 
                        vary from stopping and restarting the service explicitly 
                        (easy) to the need to replace the service instance 
                        entirely (not easy and slow). The issues can be any 
                        of the following:

                         If a Storage Node is UNREACHABLE, or a Replication Node
                         is having problems and its Storage Node is 
                         UNREACHABLE, the first thing to check is the network connectivity 
                         between the Admin and the Storage Node. However, if the 
                         managing Storage Node Agent is reachable and the managed 
                         Replication Node is not, we can guess that the network is OK 
                         and the problem lies elsewhere.

                       to restart. This is an expected restart, that is different from 
                       errorRestarting(6) (which is a restart after encountering an error).

            The following metrics can be monitored to get a sense for the
            performance of each Replication Node in the cluster. There are
            two flavors of metric granularity:

            <li>
              <p>
                   Interval – By default, each node in the cluster will
                   sample performance data every 20 seconds and aggregate
                   the metrics to this interval. This interval may be
                   changed using the admin plan change-parameters - global and
                   supplying the collectorInterval parameter with a new value
                   (see
                   <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/NOSQL/html/AdminGuide/setstoreparams.html#changeparamcli" target="_top">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/NOSQL/html/AdminGuide/setstoreparams.html#changeparamcli</a>).

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            The metrics are further broken down into measurements for
            operations over single keys versus operations over multiple
            keys.

                All timestamp metrics are in UTC, therefore appropriate conversion
                to a time zone relevant to where the store is deployed is
                necessary.
