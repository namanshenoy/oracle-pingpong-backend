            Typical errors when bringing up a store are typos and
            misconfiguration.  It is also possible to run into network port
            conflicts, especially if the deployment failed and you are
            starting over.  In that case be sure to remove all partial
            store data and configuration and kill any remnant processes.
            Processes associated with a store as reported by "jps -m" are
            one of these:
        </p>
      <table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list">
        <tr>
          <td>kvstore.jar start -root KVROOT (SNA process)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ManagedService</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
            If you kill the SNA process it should also kill its
            managed processes.
        </p>
      <p>
            There are detailed log files available in
            <code class="literal">KVROOT/storename/log</code> as well as logs of the
            bootstrap process in <code class="literal">KVROOT/*.log</code>.  The
            bootstrap logs are most useful in diagnosing initial startup
            problems.  The logs in <code class="literal">storename/log</code> appear
            once the store has been configured.  The logs on the host
            chosen for the admin process are the most detailed and include
            a store-wide consolidated log file:
            <code class="literal">KVROOT/storename/log/storename_*.log</code>
        </p>
      <p>
            Each line in a log file is prefixed with the date of the message,
            its severity, and the name of the component which issued it. For
            example:
        </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">2012-10-25 14:28:26.982 UTC INFO [admin1] 
Initializing Admin for store: kvstore </pre>
      <p>
            When looking for more context for events at a given time, use
            the timestamp and component name to narrow down the section of
            log to peruse.
        </p>
      <p>
            Error messages in the logs show up with "SEVERE" in them so you
            can grep for that if you are troubleshooting. SEVERE error
            messages are also displayed in the CLI's <code class="literal">show events</code> 
            command, and when you use the <code class="literal">ping</code> command.
        </p>
      <p>
            In addition to log files, these directories may also contain
            *.perf files, which are performance files for the Replication
            Nodes.
        </p>
      <p>
            In general, <code class="literal">verify configuration</code> is the tool of
            choice for understanding the state of the cluster. In addition to
            contacting the components, it will cross check each component's parameters
            against the Admin database. For example, <code class="literal">verify configuration</code> 
            might report that a Replication Node's helperHosts parameter was at odds
            with the Admin. If this were the case then it might explain why a Replication Node
            cannot come up. <code class="literal">Verify configuration</code> also checks
            on Admins. It also verifies the configuration of Arbiter Nodes in the
            topology.
        </p>
      <p>
            Additionally, in order to catch configuration errors early, you can use the
            diagnostics tool when troubleshooting your KVStore. Also, you can use this tool 
            to package important information and files to be able to send them to Oracle 
            Support, for example. For more information, see 
            <a class="xref" href="diag_util.html" title="Appendix G. Diagnostics Utility">Diagnostics Utility</a>

              As your store operates, you can discover information about
              any problems that may be occurring by looking at the plan
              history and by looking at error logs.
            </p>
        <p>
              The plan history indicates if any configuration or
              operational actions you attempted to take against the store
              encountered problems. This information is available as the
              plan executes and finishes. Errors are reported in the plan
              history each time an attempt to run the plan fails. The plan
              history can be seen using the CLI <code class="literal">show plan</code>
              command.
            </p>
        <p>
              Other problems may occur asynchronously. You can learn about
              unexpected failures, service downtime, and performance issues
              through the CLI's <code class="literal">show events</code> command.
              Events come with a time stamp, and the description may
              contain enough information to diagnose the issue. In other
              cases, more context may be needed, and the administrator may
              want to see what else happened around that time.
            </p>
        <p>
              The store-wide log consolidates logging output from all
              services. Browsing this file might give you a more complete
              view of activity during the problem period. It can be viewed
              using the CLI's <code class="literal">logtail</code> command, or by directly viewing
              the &lt;storename&gt;_N.log file in the
              &lt;KVHOME&gt;/&lt;storename&gt;/log directory.

                Oracle NoSQL Database uses four different types of services, all of which
                should be running correctly in order for your store to be
                in a healthy state. The four service types are the Admin,
                Storage Nodes, Replication Nodes and Arbiters Nodes. You should have
                multiple instances of these services running throughout
                your store.
            </p>
        <p>
                Each service has a status that can be viewed using any of
                the following:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

                          If an SN is UNREACHABLE, or an RN is having problems and its SN 
                          is UNREACHABLE, the first thing to check is the network 
                          connectivity between the Admin and the SN. However, if the 
                          managing SNA is reachable and the managed Replication Node is not,
                          we can guess that the network is OK and the problem lies elsewhere.
