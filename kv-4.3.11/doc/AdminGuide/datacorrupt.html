            Oracle NoSQL Database is capable of automatically detecting data corruption in
            its database.  When data corruption is detected, Oracle NoSQL Database will
            automatically shutdown the associated Admin or Replication
            Nodes. Manual administrative action is then required before
            they can be brought back online.

                Oracle NoSQL Database Admin or Replication Node processes will exit when
                they detect data corruption. This is caused by a background
                task which detects data corruption caused by a disk
                failure, or similar physical media or I/O subsystem
                problem. Typically, the corruption is detected because of a
                checksum error in a log entry in one of the data 
                (*.jdb) files contained in an Admin or Replication Node
                database environment. A data corruption error generates
                output in the debug log similar to this:

                If an Admin or Replication Node has been stopped due to
                data corruption, then manual administration intervention is
                required in order to restart the Node:

              <p>
                        If you want to send the corrupted environment to
                        Oracle support for help in identifying the root
                        cause of the failure, archive the corrupted
                        environment data files. These are usually located
                        at:

                        Before removing the files associated with the
                        corrupted environment, confirm that another copy of
                        the data is available either on another node or via
                        a previously save snapshot. For a Replication Node,
                        you must be using a Replication Factor greater than
                        1 and also have a properly operating Replication
                        Node in the store in order for the data to reside
                        elsewhere in the store. If you are using a RF=1,
                        then you must have a previously saved snapshot in
                        order to continue.

                        operating properly.
