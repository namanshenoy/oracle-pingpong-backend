      <p>
            To navigate inside complex values and select their nested
            values, SQL for Oracle NoSQL Database supports path expressions.  A path
            expression has an input expression followed by one or more steps. 
        </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">&lt;primary_expressions&gt;.&lt;step&gt;*</pre>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
                A path expression over a table row must always start with the
                table's name or the table's alias (if one was included in the
                FROM clause).
            </p>
      </div>
      <p>
            There are three kinds of path expression steps: field, filter,
            and slice steps. Field steps are used to select field/entry
            values from records or maps. Filter steps are used to select
            array or map entries that satisfy some condition. Slice steps
            are used to select array entries based on their position inside
            the containing array. A path expression can mix different kinds
            of steps.
        </p>
      <p>
            All steps iterate over their input sequence, producing zero or
            more items for each input item. If the input sequence is empty,
            the result of the step is also empty. Otherwise, the overall
            result of the step is the concatenation of the results produced
            for each input item. The input item that a step is currently
            operating on is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>context item</em></span>,
            and it is available within the step expression using the dollar
            sign ($) variable. This context-item variable exists in the
            scope created by the step expression.
        </p>
      <p>
            For all steps, if the context item is NULL, it is just added
            into the output sequence with no further processing.
        </p>
      <p>
            In general, path expressions may return more than one item as
            their result. Such multi-item results can be used as input in two
            other kinds of expressions: sequence-comparison operators and array
            constructors.

                A field step selects the value of a field from a record or
                map. The field to select is specified by its field name,
                which is either given explicitly as an identifier, or is
                computed by a name expression. The name expression must be
                of type string.
            </p>

&lt;parenthesized_expr&gt; | &lt;func_call&gt;* </pre>
        <p>
                As a simple example, the field step expression <code class="literal">u.address.city</code>:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">SELECT id, u.address.city FROM Users u;</pre>
        <p>
                Retrieves the field "city" from the "address" column in the Users ("u")
                table.
            </p>
        <p>
                A field step processes each context item as follows:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>

                        If the context item is an atomic item, it is
                        skipped (the result is empty).
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        The name expression is evaluated. If the name
                        expression returns the empty sequence or NULL, the
                        context item is skipped.  Otherwise, the evaluated
                        name expression is passed to the next step.

                    <p>
                                and if that record contains a field
                                identical to the evaluated name expression,
                                then that field is returned.  Otherwise,
                                an error is raised.

                                 and if that map contains a field identical
                                 to the evaluated name expression, then that
                                 field is returned. Otherwise, an empty result
                                 is returned.
                            </p>

                If the context item ($) is an array, then the field
                step is applied to each element of the array with the
                context item being set to the current array element. If
                the context item is an atomic item, it is skipped (the result

                A map filter step is used with records and maps to select
                either the field name (keys) or the field values of the
                fields that satisfy a given condition. This condition is
                specified as a predicate expression inside parentheses. If
                the predicate expression is missing, it is assumed to be
                <code class="literal">true</code> — all the field names or
                values are returned.
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">&lt;primary_expression&gt;.keys | values (&lt;predicate&gt;) </pre>
        <p>
                where <code class="literal">keys</code> references the record's or map's field name, and
                <code class="literal">values</code> references the record's or map's field values.
            </p>
        <p>
                In addition to the context-item variable ($), the predicate
                expression may reference the following two variables: $key
                is bound to the name of the context field — that is,
                the current field in $, and $value is bound to the value of
                the context field. The predicate expression must be
                boolean. 
            </p>
        <p>
                A simple example is <code class="literal">u.expenses.keys($value &gt; 1000)</code>, 
                which selects all the expenses greater than $1000. Combined with
                this query:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">SELECT id, u.expenses.keys($value &gt; 1000) FROM Users u; </pre>
        <p>
                all the user IDs and expense fields are returned where more
                than 1000 was spent. 
            </p>
        <p>
                A map filter step processes each context item as follows:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the context item is an atomic item, it is
                        skipped (the result is empty).
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the context item is a record or map, the step
                        iterates over its fields. For each field, the
                        predicate expression is evaluated.  A NULL or an
                        empty result from the predicate expression is
                        treated as a false value. If the predicate result
                        is true, the context field is selected and either
                        its name or its value is returned; otherwise the
                        context field is skipped.

        <p>
                An array filter step is used with arrays to select elements
                of arrays by evaluating a predicate expression for each
                element. Elements are selected or rejected depending on the
                results of the predicate expression.  If the predicate expression is missing,
                it is assumed to be <code class="literal">true</code> — all the
                array elements are returned.
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">[&lt;primary_expression&gt;[&lt;predicate_expression&gt;]] </pre>
        <p>
                Notice in the syntax that the entire expression is enclosed
                in square brackets ([]). This is the array constructor. Use
                of the array constructor is frequently required in order to
                obtain the desired result, and so we show it here. The use
                of the explicit array constructor guarantees that the
                records in the result set will always have an array as
                their second field.  For example:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">SELECT lastName,
[ u.address.phones[$element.area = 650].number ] AS phoneNumbers
FROM Users u; </pre>
        <p>
                Assume that <code class="literal">u.address.phones</code> references
                one or more phone numbers. Without the array constructor,
                the result records would contain an array for users with
                more than one phone (because the information would be held
                in an array in the store anyway), but just a single integer
                for users with just one phone.  For users with just one
                phone, the phones field might not be an array (containing a
                single phone object), but just a single phone object. If
                such a single phone object has area code 650, its number
                will be selected, as expected.
            </p>
        <p>
                In addition to the context-item variable ($), the predicate
                expression may reference the following two variables:
                $element is bound to the current element in $, and $pos is
                bound to the position of the context element within $.
                Positions are counted starting with 0.
            </p>
        <p>
                An array filter step processes each context item as follows:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the context item is not an array, an array is
                        created and the context item is added to that
                        array. Then the array filter is applied to this
                        single-item array.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the context item is an array, the step iterates
                        over the array elements and computes the predicate
                        expression on each element. 
                    </p>
              <p>
                        The predicate expression must return a boolean
                        item, or a numeric item, or the empty sequence, or
                        NULL. A NULL or an empty result from the predicate
                        expression is treated as a false value. If the
                        predicate result is true/false, the context element
                        is selected/skipped, respectively. If the predicate
                        result is a number, the context element is selected
                        only if $pos equals that number.  This means that
                        if the predicate result is a negative number, or
                        greater or equal to the array size, the context
                        element is skipped.

                An array slice step is used with arrays to select elements
                of arrays based on element position.
                The elements to select are identified by specifying boundary
                positions which identify "low" position and "high" positions.
                Each boundary expression must return at most one item of
                type LONG or INTEGER, or NULL. The low and/or the high
                expression may be missing. The context-item variable ($) is
                available during the computation of the boundary
                expressions.

        <p>
                For example, assume an array of connects ordered from the 
                strongest connect (position 0) to the weakest, select the strongest
                connection for the user with id 10:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">select connections[0] as strongestConnection from Users
where id = 10;</pre>
        <p>
                Select user 10's five strongest connections, and return the array (notice
                the use of the array constructor):
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">select [ connections[0:4] ] as strongConnections from Users
where id = 10; </pre>
        <p>
                Select user 10's five weakest connections:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">select [ connections[size($) - 5 : ] ] as weakConnections from Users
where id = 10; </pre>
        <p>
                An array slice step processes each context item as follows:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the context item is not an array, an array is
                        created and the context item is added to that
                        array. Then the array filter is applied to this
                        single-item array.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        If the context item is an array, the boundary
                        expressions (if any) are evaluated.  
                    </p>
              <p>
                        If any boundary expression returns NULL or an empty
                        result, the context item is skipped.
                    </p>
              <p>
                        Otherwise, if the low expression is absent, or if
                        it evaluates to less than 0, the lower boundary is
                        set to 0. If the high expression is absent, or if
                        it evaluates to higher than the array_size -1, it
                        is set to array_size - 1. 
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        After the low and high positions are determined,
                        the step selects all the elements positions, inclusively,
                        between those two boundaries. If the low position is greater
                        than the high position, then no elements are selected.
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
