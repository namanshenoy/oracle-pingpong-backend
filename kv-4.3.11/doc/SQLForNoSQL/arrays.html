        You can use slice or filter steps to select elements out of an array.
        We start with some examples using slice steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        To select and display the second connection of each person, we use:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT lastname, connections[1]
AS connection FROM Persons;
 +----------+------------+
 | lastname | connection |
 +----------+------------+
 | Scully   |          2 |
 | Smith    |          4 |
 | Morgan   |          2 |
 | Anderson |          2 |
 | Morrison |          2 |
 +----------+------------+

5 rows returned </pre>
      <p>
        In the above example, the slice step <code class="literal">[1]</code> is
        applied to the connections array. Array elements are numbered
        starting with 0, so 1 is used to select the second connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        A slice step can also be used to select all array elements whose
        positions are within a range: [low:high], where low and high are
        expressions that compute the range boundaries. The low and/or the
        high expressions may be missing if no low and/or high boundary is
        desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following query returns the lastname and the first
        3 connections of person 5 as strongconnections:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT lastname, [connections[0:2]]
AS strongconnections FROM Persons WHERE id = 5;
 +----------+-------------------+
 | lastname | strongconnections |
 +----------+-------------------+
 | Scully   | 2                 |
 |          | 4                 |
 |          | 1                 |
 +----------+-------------------+

1 row returned </pre>
      <p>
        In the above query, for Person 5, the path expression
          <code class="literal">connections[0:2]</code> returns the person's first 3
        connections. Here, the range is [0:2], so 0 is the low expression and 2 is
        the high expression. The path expression returns its result as a sequence of
        3 items.
      </p>
      <p>
        The path expression appears inside the SELECT clause, which does not
        allow expressions that return more than one item. Therefore, the path expression
        should be enclosed in an array-constructor expression ([]), which creates a
        new array (single item) containing the 3 connections. Although the query
        shell displays the elements of this constructed array vertically, the number
        of rows returned by this query is 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, you can omit the low or high expression when
        specifying the range for a slice step. For example the following query
        specifies a range of [3:] which returns all connections after the third one.
        Notice that for persons having only 3 connections or less, an empty array is
        constructed and returned.
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT id, [connections[3:]]
AS weakConnections FROM Persons;
+----+-----------------+
| id | weakConnections |
+----+-----------------+
|  4 | 2               |
+----+-----------------+
|  3 |                 |
+----+-----------------+
|  2 |                 |
+----+-----------------+
|  1 |                 |
+----+-----------------+
|  5 | 3               |
+----+-----------------+

5 rows returned </pre>
      <p>
        As a last example of slice steps, the following query returns the last
        3 connections of each person. In this query, the slice step is
          <code class="literal">[size($)-3:]</code>. In this expression, the $ is an
        implicitly declared variable that references the array that the slice step
        is applied to. In this example, $ references the connections array. The
        size() built-in function returns the size (number of elements) of the input
        array. So, in this example, size($) is the size of the current connections
        array. Finally, size($)-3 computes the third position from the end of the
        current connections array.
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT id, [connections[size($)-3:]]
AS weakConnections FROM Persons;
 +----+-------------------+
 | id | weakConnections   |
 +----+-------------------+
 |  5 | 4                 |
 |    | 1                 |
 |    | 3                 |
 +----+-------------------+
 |  4 | 5                 |
 |    | 1                 |
 |    | 2                 |
 +----+-------------------+
 |  3 | 1                 |
 |    | 4                 |
 |    | 2                 |
 +----+-------------------+
 |  2 | 1                 |
 |    | 3                 |
 +----+-------------------+
 |  1 | 2                 |
 |    | 3                 |
 +----+-------------------+

5 rows returned </pre>
      <p>
        We now turn our attention to filter steps on arrays. Like slice steps,
        filter steps use the square brackets ([]) syntax as well. However, what goes
        inside the [] is different. With filter steps there is either nothing inside
        the [] or a single expression that acts as a condition (returns a boolean
        result). In the former case, all the elements of the array are selected (the
        array is "unnested"). In the latter case, the condition is applied to each
        element in turn, and if the result is true, the element is selected,
        otherwise it is skipped. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        The following query returns the id and connections of persons who are
        connected to person 4:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT id, connections
FROM Persons p WHERE p.connections[] =any 4;
 +----+-------------+
 | id | connections |
 +----+-------------+
 |  3 | 1           |
 |    | 4           |
 |    | 2           |
 +----+-------------+
 |  5 | 2           |
 |    | 4           |
 |    | 1           |
 |    | 3           |
 +----+-------------+

2 rows returned </pre>
      <p>
        In the above query, the expression <code class="literal">p.connections[]</code>
        returns all the connections of a person. Then, the =any operator returns
        true if this sequence of connections contains the number 4.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following query returns the id and connections of persons who are
        connected with any person having an id greater than 4:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT id, connections FROM Persons p
WHERE p.connections[] &gt;any 4;
 +----+-------------+
 | id | connections |
 +----+-------------+
 |  4 | 3           |
 |    | 5           |
 |    | 1           |
 |    | 2           |
 +----+-------------+

1 row returned </pre>
      <p>
        The following query returns, for each person, the person's last name
        and the phone numbers with area code 339:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT lastname,
[ p.address.phones[$element.areacode = 339].number ]
AS phoneNumbers FROM Persons p;
 +----------+--------------+
 | lastname | phoneNumbers |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Scully   | 3414578      |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Smith    | 4120211      |
 |          | 8694021      |
 |          | 1205678      |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Morgan   |              |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Anderson | 1684972      |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Morrison |              |
 +----------+--------------+

5 rows returned </pre>
      <p>
        In the above query, the filter step <code class="literal">[$element.areacode =
          339]</code> is applied to the phones array of each person. The filter
        step evaluates the condition <code class="literal">$element.areacode = 339</code> on
        each element of the array. This condition expression uses the implicitly
        declared variable $element, which references the current element of the
        array. Because the whole path expression may return more than one phone
        number, it is enclosed in an array constructor to collect the selected phone
        numbers into a single array. An empty array is returned for persons that do
        not have any phone number in the 339 area code. If we wanted to filter out
        such persons from the result, we would write the following query:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT lastname,
[ p.address.phones[$element.areacode = 339].number ]
AS phoneNumbers FROM Persons p WHERE p.address.phones.areacode =any 339;
 +----------+--------------+
 | lastname | phoneNumbers |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Scully   | 3414578      |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Smith    | 4120211      |
 |          | 8694021      |
 |          | 1205678      |
 +----------+--------------+
 | Anderson | 1684972      |
 +----------+--------------+

3 rows returned </pre>
      <p>
        In addition to the implicitly-declared $ and $element variables, the
        condition inside a filter step can also use the $pos variable (also
        implicitly declared). $pos references the position within the array
        of the current element (the element on which the condition is applied). For
        example, the following query selects the "interesting" connections of each
        person, where a connection is considered interesting if it is among the 3
        strongest connections and connects to a person with an id greater or equal
        to 4.
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT id, [p.connections[$element &gt;= 4 and $pos &lt; 3]]
AS interestingConnections FROM Persons p;
 +----+------------------------+
 | id | interestingConnections |
 +----+------------------------+
 |  5 | 4                      |
 +----+------------------------+
 |  4 | 5                      |
 +----+------------------------+
 |  3 | 4                      |
 +----+------------------------+
 |  2 |                        |
 +----+------------------------+
 |  1 |                        |
 +----+------------------------+

5 rows returned </pre>
      <p>
        Finally, two arrays can be compared with each other using the usual
        comparison operators (=, !=, &gt;, &gt;=, &gt;, and &gt;=). For example the
        following query constructs the array [1,3] and selects persons whose
        connections array is equal to [1,3].
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">sql-&gt; SELECT lastname FROM Persons p
WHERE p.connections = [1,3];
 +----------+
 | lastname |

 | Anderson |
