/**
 * An index iteration that returns row values.  The index is specified by a
 * combination of the indexName and tableName.  The index scan range and
 * additional parameters are specified by the IndexRange.
 *
 * Both primary and secondary keys are required for resumption of batched
 * operations because a single index match may match a large number of
 * primary records. In order to honor batch size constraints a single
 * request/reply operation may need to resume within a set of duplicates.
 *
 * When ancestor tables are requested the operation will fetch the requested
 * ancestor row for any matching rows, and if present, add it to the result
 * list.  Ancestor rows are returned before the corresponding target table row.
 * This is true even if the iteration is in reverse order.  In the event of
 * multiple index entries matching the same primary entry and/or ancestor entry,
 * duplicate rows will be returned.
 *
 *
 * The childTables parameter is a list of child tables to return. These are not
 * supported in R3 and will be null.
 *
 * The ancestorTables parameter, if not null, specifies the ancestor tables to
 * return in addition to the target table, which is the table containing the
 * index.
 *
 * The resumeSecondaryKey parameter is used for batching of results and will be
 * null on the first call
 *
 * The resumePrimaryKey is used for batching of results and will be null
 * on the first call
 *
 * The batchSize parameter is the batch size to to use
